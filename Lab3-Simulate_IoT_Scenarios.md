# Lab 3: Simulate IoT Scenarios
---

In this series of labs, I will collect multiple sensors to the GrovePi+ to simulate some simple IoT Scenarios.

I'll try to leverage the 7 Grove Sensors enabled in Lab2 series to create some simple IoT projects. 

## [Project 1: Light control](Lab3.a-Light_Control.md)
In this project, I will use the Grove Button to control the Chainable RGB LED.

## [Project 2: Over-tempereature alert](Lab3.b-Over-temperature_Alert.md)
In this project, I will use the Grove Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11) and Grove Buzzer to simulate a over-temperature alert scenario.

## [Project 3: Sound monitor](Lab3.c-Sound_Monitor.md)
In this project, I will use the Grove Sound Sensor and the Grove OLED Display to create a sound monitoring case where the environment sound value will be displayed on the LED Display.

You can definitely create more scenarios based on the sensors you have, your target and/or interest.
